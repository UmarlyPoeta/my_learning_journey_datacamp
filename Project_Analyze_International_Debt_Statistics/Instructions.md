# Introduction
    Humans not only take debts to manage necessities. A country may also    take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending  is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead   comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides   debt to countries.

    In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data   collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the   amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several   categories. You are going to find the answers to the following    questions:

        - What is the number of distinct countries present in the database?
        - What country has the highest amount of debt?
        - What country has the lowest amount of repayments?

    Below is a description of the table you will be working with:
    international_debt table
    Column	Definition	Data Type
    country_name	Name of the country	varchar
    country_code	Code representing the country	varchar
    indicator_name	Description of the debt indicator	varchar
    indicator_code	Code representing the debt indicator	varchar
    debt	Value of the debt indicator for the given country (in current   US dollars)	float

You will execute SQL queries to answer three questions, as listed in the instructions.
